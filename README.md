## 5. Complete setup/installion/usage
State what a user needs to do when they come to your project.  How do others start using your code or application?
Here are the steps ...
* 1 - If users are using Savebites for the first time, they will need to click "Start" then register for a new acocunt following the standard Google sign-in interface
* 2 - Once the users have logged in, they are already good to go to start using Savebites.
* 3 - Reommendation after logging in: Check out the Home Page for hot deals and start liking, or adding it to your Favourites list.
* 4 - Also consider uploading a post for any hot deals you may have found and give back to the community.



## 6. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* When a user tries to take a picture with the camera on user's device, the file isn't being saved in the firebase, so it is not showing in the uploaded post. (Camera button is hidden now)
* Map does not default to the closest Safeway, Save-On-Foods, etc.
* Map's icon results is not clickable.



## 7. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Fix mobile camera so users can upload a photo they directly with the phone camera
* Make Map more interactive by allowing it to add a location via touch as opposed to text only.
* We are going to use more Bootstrap libraries in the future to create more animation and beautiful effect to decorate our UI.
* Automatically hide posts on Home Page if the deal has expired.
* Automatically hide posts with a large amount of dislikes.
* Add OCR features so fields are automatically filled in the Upload Posts page.
